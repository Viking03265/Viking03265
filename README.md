  I have been using the term "Viking Coder" for a several years now. Honestly, it was a "equal and opposite" reaction to the rise of the Rockstar Ninja Samurai whatever in job descriptions. I don't play a guitar or dress in black PJ's. I am a big coder, and I like big, simple solutions to problems. And I have a least a little bit of Scandinavian in me.

I wanted to open this up, so steal, pull, push away!

Thus the âœ¨Viking Coderâœ¨ was born.

The Viking coder is also a response to many of the Agile practices out there...
